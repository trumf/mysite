                <p> Many artists struggle to generate a consistent source of income, often waiting months or even
                    years to receive royalties for their music. Our product offers a solution to this problem by
                    providing a way for artists to receive their royalties quicker. As the designer of this product,
                    my task was to redesign an existing app and create a seamless and enjoyable user experience for
                    artists. It was important to me that the product be both trustworthy and safe for artists to
                    use, as well as attractive to our B2B customers.

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>To identify our target audience, we conducted a workshop with representatives from different teams
                    including product, engineering, customer operations, and data science. <br>
                    We identified five key user groups, two on the B2B partner side (developers who valued ease of use
                    and documentation, and business owners focused on ROI) and three on the consumer side (emerging
                    creators, established creators, and artist managers). We decided to focus on emerging and
                    established artists for the first version of our product. <br>
                    After an audit of our product, we found that our existing app had some shortcomings, such as lengthy
                    process and requiring multiple devices and channels to complete the process.</p>

            <div>


                <p>The redesign process began with a workshop where we took our time to map out the software
                    architecture and decide on where we could improve the users experience through third party
                    services.
                </p>

            </div>



            <div class="">

                <p>We broke down the design work into functional areas, focusing on each specific purpose of the
                    process. By doing this, we were able to develop each area for a first draft, which gave us a
                    good
                    sense of how everything was coming together.</p>


                <div style="width: 100%;display: flex; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;">
                    <div class="image-wrapper" style="">

            </div>




            <div class="paragraph_wrapper">
                <p>The design started with identifying the components needed for each stage and initial sketching of
                    ideas.We then fleshed out these ideas into mockup screens that had most of the necessary components.
                    This
                    helped us to visualise the app and ensure that we were on the right track. To make the app easy to
                    use
                    on any device, we tested the mockups on different device sizes. This
                    helped us to spot any issues with the responsive design and make adjustments as needed.</p>

                <p>With all the stages of the process designed, we were able to do user studies with figma prototypes

                <div class="content-container">



                    <p>The draft design used an old version of the design system. Half way through the draft process the
                        company moved to a new brand design. The new brand guidelines lacked UI direction, so we
                        explored variations to incorporate the brand within the app.</p>

                    <div class="utopia__image-label">
                        <div class="utopia-image-wrapper">

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph_wrapper">



                <p>The old design system was soft and round with heavy use of the primary brand color and no dark mode.
                    The new brand guidelines emphasized heavy imagery, distorted type, and hard angles.
                    We started with incorporating the new imagery and bold colors, but quickly ruled out distorted type
                    as it was not suitable for the app.</p>

                            customers.
                            So,
                            we toned it down,
                            keeping some of the brand imagery, and after a third round of revisions, we settled on a
                            design
                            that
                            aligned with other

                        This, along with a better plan for following up with customers, will lead to improved trust and
