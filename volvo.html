                <p>My five years at Volvo Cars were marked by my significant involvement in the development of the EX90 and Polestar 3, as well as the platforms they were built on. <br>
                    In a lead designer role, I defined user and business value for future features and established roadmaps, and as design manager, I supported my teams in designing the UX and UIs for a range of systems and features. I also created design visions for the organization and implemented processes to improve our work. The EX90 and Polestar 3 reflect some of these efforts.</p>

                    The EX90 from Volvo features a user interface with a welcome screen upon entering the car, which focuses on quick controls and common actions. As the car is started, the home screen is updated to provide important information and access to navigation, media, phone, and controls.<br><br>
                    There is also a special contextual bar that suggests relevant information based on the vehicle's state, such as parked or driving, and helps provide the right actions without overwhelming the screen. This user interface will improve over time and become smarter based on usage patterns.

                    The EX90 from Volvo features a driving mode awareness system. In normal driving, the system provides support, in assisted driving it shares information to help the driver understand the level of assistance they can expect, and in autonomous driving, it takes over the driving task.<br>
The safety system also helps visualise what the sensors see around the car and updates the screen with relevant information and actions. The EX90 will eventually offer unsupervised autonomous driving under certain conditions, allowing the driver to delegate the driving task. The user interface is designed to provide a safe and contextual experience that will improve over time.

                    I played a role in the development of Volvo's driver understanding system, which monitors the driver's attention levels and intervenes to maintain safety if necessary.<br>
Using advanced eye gaze pattern detection and two cameras for added accuracy, the system is able to identify when the driver is drowsy, distracted, or intoxicated, and takes action such as reducing speed or braking to a stop to prevent accidents. This system will work in conjunction with exterior sensing to improve safety and eventually enable autonomous driving.

                    Volvo plans to introduce an interior radar system in the EX90 that covers the entire cabin to help prevent children or pets from being left behind in the car. The system, which will be standard where regulation allows, will detect movement and breathing at a sub-millimeter scale and will remind the driver to check the interior of the car when movement is detected and the car is being locked.<br>
The system is also connected to the in-car climate system, which will be on whenever there is someone in the car, to provide comfort and potentially reduce the risk of hypothermia or heatstroke. The system will be enhanced over time and may be linked to the Volvo Cars app in the future for added peace of mind.
