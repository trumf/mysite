        <p>I’m trying to figure out how to deal with all the layoffs in tech and for UX designers. I’m writing this for
            myself,
            to myself, to figure out my thoughts where UX design have been and where it’s going and how I can advise the
            more junior designers on my team. </p>

        <p>As you may know I’m trying to get an overview for myself on the current state of UX. <a
                href="./UXproffesion.html">Last time</a> I wrote about
            all the
            different roles that got incorporated under “UX Design” by the time I started getting into it. Today I will
            try to
            sketch out some current developments.</p>

        <h2>Graphic designers became brand designers</h2>

        <div class="paragraph-wrapper">

            <p>I will keep this brief since I mostly work in large enterprise environments and don’t often come in
                contact with this
                type design. It seems like there has been a shift to calling yourself Brand designer for may of the
                people who might
                earlier have been graphic designers. I’m guessing that there were more and more customers out there that
                wanted
                things like logos and other brand assets and slowly people just started calling themselves brand
                designers. This
                group of people work as freelancers or in agencies more often than the other groups.</p>

        <h2>UX designers became Product designers</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-wrapper">

            <p>UX designers have always had it tricky to justify themselves. There have been a lot of discourse about
                how designers
                should change. “You need to learn about business”/“you need to learn how to code” and I don’t know how
                many articles
                I’ve read about showing ROI of design. I think that if you were leaning more towards the business side
                you started
                calling yourself a product designer in 2020 and if you liked to code then you might slowly be moving
                into a design
                engineer role right now.</p>
            <p>Being a product designer I think also reflects the changing climate around design. Compared to the
                beginning of the
                2010s we don’t talk as much about representing users any more. We were maybe a bit idealistic back then
                and maybe
                right now we are a bit cynical and jaded (There seemed like there was a potential back then to work
                towards
                something larger than ourself and more important than a bottom line. That potential seems gone now).
                Today you need
                to justify yourself by showing how you improved various metrics that are important to the bottom line.

        <h2>Design engineering</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-wrapper">

            <p>There have recently been some good articles written about the design engineer and what they do (<a
                    href="https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel">example,</a> <a
                    href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/the-case-for-design-engineers-pt-ii/">example,</a> <a
                    href="https://maggieappleton.com/design-engineers">example</a>). For the
                purpose of
                this post I lump in all kinds of “designers who code” under this category. I also put design system
                engineers/designers in this category. The design system have helped product designers enormously. In an
                enterprise
                environment it is not uncommon for product designers to drag and drop readymade components in Figma
                (sort of similar
                to wire framing) and this would not be possible without design systems.</p>
            <p>For a company of small or mid size I think it makes a ton of sense to hire someone who can sketch out an
                interface
                and then code it. In large companies it probably depends more on that particular organisation. There can
                be a lot of
                politics and protecting of ones turf which makes a design engineer a bit difficult to fit in. Unless
                they work in a
                design system team of course. </p>

        <h2>Product managers stepping in</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-wrapper">

            <p>Although PMs have a background from marketing they are one of those roles that really grew up when the
                FAANGs started
                using SCRUM and Agile. Today the PM role is often described as being the voice of the customer. This
                used to be
                something that UX designers would claim. Maybe they still do? But UX design seems to have de-emphised
                the research
                part of the profession as time has gone on. The nature of research have also changed: I see less and
                less discussion
                about qualitative research methods while there have been an explosion in quantitative techniques. PMs
                are more often
                seen looking at a dashboard of quantitative data rather than post its for a thematic analysis.</p>

            <p>These are the major ways I think the UX designer is evolving. I don’t want to say that they are
                dissappearing but I
                believe the role was very broad from the beginning and it makes it hard to defend a role and a
                competency. I feel
                like we are moving toward a future with fewer UX design generalist and more product designers, PMs,
                Design
                engineers, and brand designers where the UX designer used to be. I feel like I need to put into words
                how this
                changes things and how you might stay ahead and ride this wave. </p>
            <p>I’ll end here with a reminder that these are very subjective impressions backed up by nothing. If you
                have a
                different view or would like to comment then please reach out. It’s easiest on <a
