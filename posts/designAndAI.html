      <h2>Jakob Nielsen and an "Urgency around AI"</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        It all started when I read an article titled <a
          href="https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/ux-needs-a-sense-of-urgency-about">
          "Design Needs an Urgency for AI."</a> It is written by jakob nielsen (who has had a steeak of very
        bad takes as i’m writing this. But, as somone who is actually worried
        baout what might happen and how i might be bale to keep my job it
        stressed me out. It complains that engineers are taking charge and
        defining what AI is right now, instructing designers to start using AI
        and learning it without offering concrete advice on what it entails.
        So, I went searching the internet to figure out what could actually be
        useful to learn as a designer.

      <h2>What does it mean to "Learn AI"?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Luckily, I came across an article from a
          <a href="https://speckyboy.com/grumpy-designer-ponders-what-it-means-to-learn-ai/">Grumpy designer who wonders
            what it means to learn AI</a>
          Right now, we're at a starting point, something that's been thrown
          out a lot is becoming a proficient designer in prompt engineering.
          He sees this as something designers should excel at because it's
          about articulating what you actually want to do, and it's about
          communication skills. But he also points out, and i agree with this,
          is that this is a short term opportunity. right now writing good
          prompts is very important but as this field matures this is one of
          the things it will try to improve the most on. We expect all these
          AI models to get better and better at understanding what people can
          do better, so there's a short period when we'll have professions
          like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other thing he suggests is that one can use APIs to build on
          ideas, and this could be a killer feature right now. Learning how to
          connect to an API and build valuable things on top, might be the
          most promising course forward imo. The problem is that this requires
          a skillset quite different from what you would expect from a
          “designer” designer. Of course, being able to do research and
          identify users painpoints will always be helpful but research skills
          have been downprioritised in the designers arsenal during the last
          decade or so.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last advice, and i saw many others give this advice, is to just
          start using AI tools and become good at it. there is a learning
          curve to be able to craft the right prompt to get what you want.
          this is very common advice but i’m unhappy with it. we are
          essentially telling designers to learn tools in a situation when the
          tools will most likely not last. What one needs to learn is how to
          understand how to get what they want from an AI, how to generate
          prompts, and guide so that you get a useful result.
        </p>
        <p>It is not a resilient skill since it requires constant
          upkeep and the expertise you gain is the very thing the service
          providers will try to automate away.

      <p>This Forbes article emphasizes the importance of understanding generative AI, focusing on its underlying
        mechanics.
        While this insight may not be universally necessary, they proceed to discuss its potential impact on job
        security.
        Contrary to the notion that AI threatens only specific roles, it's evident that automation affects various job
        markets. Therefore, it's essential to assess the core skills of your profession and determine their
        susceptibility
        to AI automation. Even roles with minimal exposure to automation should consider incorporating generative AI
        into
        their workflow to stay relevant.
      </p>
      <p>The article suggests two approaches to navigate the evolving job landscape: embracing AI or focusing on
        human-centric skills. While mastering AI tools is one option, cultivating skills like creativity, critical
        thinking,
        leadership, empathy, and relationship-building can also future-proof your career. By focusing on these areas,
        individuals can enhance their value in roles less likely to be automated by AI.

    <h2>How might designers stay competetive?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Then, I read this article titled
        <a
          href="https://uxdesign.cc/navigating-the-ai-revolution-how-designers-can-stay-competitive-7798bc664210?sk=bd971c5207c1ca8c0311e3086a92e427">"How
          Might Designers Stay Competitive in the AI Revolution."</a>
        They argue that there are three different use cases for AI right now (i want to dig deeper into the
        applications for ai later):
      <ul>
        <li>Provide human-like answers </li>
        <li>Generate content</li>
        <li>Generate graphics </li>
      </ul> Since AI will be able to quickly and
      cheaply create mockups for visual design they, kinda, advice against
      anything that has to do with pushing pixels. The advice is to become
      proficient in these tools and increase one's own efficiency to become
      a productive designer with these new tools. However, they also believe
      that one should start working on their social intelligence and focus
      more on human-centered design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Becoming proficient with these tools will help you keep up but will
        not give you and edge in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        A somewhat different perspective comes from a source discussing
        <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/01/ai-dilemma-graphic-design-typography/">dilemma of graphic
          design.</a>
        They start by stating that we expect there to be two types of special
        tools: one is AI co-pilot, and the other is fully automated. over time
        we will move to the fully automated version but right now we are in a
        co-pilot stage. I really want to dig deeper into these metaphors later
        These models have become quite good at generating raster graphics with
        pixels, but there are still very few that are used for vector graphics
        and curves. They say that it may be because algorithmically, it has
        been seen that they have not seen as many applications for this. Here
        is something that could be taken, they see a very large opportunity
        for style transfer for language generation, especially when it comes
        to producing fonts for languages that are very different, such as
        Mandarin and Japanese.
      </p>
      <p>
        As designers face a crossroads, either we use AI to become more
        creative and efficient, or we can let AI and its quality of our work
        become so much easier to produce both images and fonts. When that
        happens, we will have very low-quality images, so designers can still
        have an edge here by having good taste and knowing what good design
        actually looks like, and not using bad design elements. i think this
        is proably the most robust skill for designers: being able to identify
        and produce high quality work. with the prolifferantion of AI for
        design there will be a lot of garbage out there. they talk about it in
        the context of fonts but it hink this is true in general. They
        conclude with a speculation that we might use design and text on web
        pages more like custom writing rather than fonts which is a very
        interesting future.

      <h2>So... to sum up</h2>
      <p>
        The urgency is still there and the takes on how to adapt to AI are not really satisfying to me. The advice to
        'just start playing around with the tools' feels reactive to me. It lacks an analysis on how things are
        changing. I suppose 'move with the times' is not bad advice but could we maybe be a bit more strategic?
      </p>
      <p>I hope to follow up on this but for now i guess i'll have to join with the rest and hope that simply by
        engaging with it I will adapt to it...</p>
