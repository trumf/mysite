      <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">I read two interesting articles the other day. One about how you build personality
        into AI and the other about
        hands on
        experiences building AI products. They sort of complimented each other and also made me think about something i
        learned
        back in university when i studied urban resilience.
      </p>

      <h2>AI personality</h2>

      <p>The first article talks <a
          href="https://productify.substack.com/p/ai-models-product-market-fit-and?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2">about
          the personality of an AI</a> and how that can be a selling point in the product
        market fit.
        OpenAI is for example more permissive than googles Gemini. This have some guys on twitter up in arms but making
        a “safe”
        AI can help attract different kinds of user groups. If a company want a certain tone and to prevent their AI
        assistant
        to say controversial stuff you can use Gemini, for others there’s Grok…</p>

      <p>Thinking about how these companies are trying to compete on things other than accuracy, speed, etc. I thought
        would come
        later when these technologies are more commodified. Interesting.</p>

      <p>Another things that struck me while reading it is that all of these companies are trying to position themselves
        to be
        THE AI service. Their ambition is to become the next platform in AI similar to Google in search, Facebook in
        socials, or
        Amazon in sales. right now we have so many options because everyone is trying to make a bet to be the next
        monopoly.
        Investors are happy to bet on a dark horse because, if worse comes to worse, they will be acquired.</p>

      <p>There have been laws proposed about AI and what data they are based on and how they are allowed to be used but
        what we
        really need to have a discussion about is how to prevent more monopolies (and dismantle the ones we already
        have).</p>

      <h2>Hands-on advice</h2>
      <p>Going from the boardroom to the shop floor: <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/squish-structure">this article
          is about the learnings during hands on building of AI</a>
        products.
        The discussion in the news is that AI will come in and completely take over. You just feed the AI some input and
        write a
        prompt and they do the whole job. This framing reinforces the idea of a big monopoly platform that can do
        everything
        (and also AGI, a topic I dont want to touch with a stick).</p>

      <p>One of the key takeaways from the post is that you shouldn’t try to do everything because it will be bad and
        you will
        fail. Instead find a narrow use-case and build a tailor made solution powered by AI that is tailor made to make
        it good.
        This is so realistic and practical that i was surprised to find it in a post about AI. And, it reflects the
        thoughts of
        someone working on the sharp end of AI.</p>

      <h2>Blunt and sharp ends</h2>
      <p>While at university i studied urban resilience and safety and disaster studies. Very interesting topics for
        people who
        likes to mix technology, culture, organizations, and education.</p>

      <p>During this i read about the concept of the “sharp and blunt end” of organizations. Let’s say that there is a
        big
        accident. The sharp end of that accent will be the ambulance people who come to the scene and pick up people and
        get
        them into the hospital. They are hands on, they are under time pressure, and they are working with limited
        understanding
        of the overall picture (among many other things).</p>

      <p>On the other side you have the blunt end of the organization. These are the administrators and managers at the
        hospital,
        and at the really blunt end you have politicians who allocate budget. Here time move more slowly, you can wait
        with a
        decision until the next department meeting.</p>



      <p>The needs and responsibilities are very different between the blunt and sharp end and it feels like we view the
        AI from
        a blunt perspective. the details and hands on needs are waved away and instead there are some poorly made
        studies that
        simplifies things way too much. Maybe it’s just the sources i read when it comes to AI and I should adjust my
        media
        diet.</p>
    </div>



    <p>I dont really have a point about this other than there were two articles that made me think and an old concept
      to tie
      them together. The blunt end/sharp end is also very useful tool when discussing B2B products, just throwing it
      out
      there. Give the articles a read.</p>
